# BestSellingProducts-Magento2

# Overview

The Best Selling Products extension for Magento 2 has been developed by the product team at RLTSquare. This extension displays your best selling products on the home page and other pages that you want so customers can view and easily buy them if they want. We have implemented AJAX Lazy Load on the slider to decrease the page load time of the website and to fetch only those images or thumbnails from the database that fits on the screen size of the webpage. We can exclude or include out of stock products. Our extension provides many options for settings in the admin panel.

Here are some of the salient features for the extension:

```
1. Shows the bestsellers in your store
2. Apply AJAX Lazy Load on slider where all the products are displayed
3. Visible on Home, Product and Category Page
4. Exclude or include out of stock products from the slider
5. Effectively display bestseller products in the slider or grid layout.
6. You can set best seller products limit
7. Enable/Disable auto scroll products in slider
```
